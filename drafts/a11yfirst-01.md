## What is A11yFirst for CKEditor?

A11yFirst is a set of document editing enhancements for CKEditor that promote
and encourage _the creation of accessible content as you edit_.

These enhancements fall into two categories:

1. A reorganization of the editor toolbar to emphasize document structure
1. The addition of accessibility-oriented features delivered via plugins,
   most of which replace standard features:
    * Heading / Paragraph
    * Character Style
    * Link
    * Image
    * Help

## Benefits of Using A11yFirst

A11yFirst for CKEditor promotes a _new model_ of proactive editing for the
creation of accessible content.

### Why was a new model needed?

If the goal is helping authors understand how to make their content
accessible, the reactive model of fixing problems after they happen is
ineffective for the following reasons:

* Accessibility checkers typically provide a laundry list of problems that
  need to be fixed.
* Going through the list and “fixing” the problems typically does not provide
  the types of learning experiences that help people better understand
  accessibility.
* When running the checker is the last step in the process, it's too easy to
  forget (or skip altogether).
* Because timing is important! For example, the best time to add alt. text for
  an image is when the image is added to the document, i.e., when its purpose
  is apparent, making it easier to answer the question: “What information does
  this image provide at this point in the document?”
