DRES, a division of the College of Applied Health Sciences (AHS) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has been involved with designing and developing software tools for accessibility since the early 2000's. The main tools it has developed are:

* [Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE)](/tools/fae), a web application for evaluating websites
* [AInspector WCAG](/tools/ainspector-wcag), a Firefox browser extension for evaluating a web page
* [Accessibility Bookmarklets](/tools/accessibility-bookmarklets), visualization tools developed in conjunction with Pixo
* [A11yFirst for CKEditor](/tools/a11yfirst), used for CMS authoring of accessible content

## Evaluation Tools

FAE and AInspector WCAG provide comprehensive web accessibility evaluations, organized by rule categories. They share the same [Evaluation Library](/tools/evaluation-library) and rulesets, but differ in other important ways.

FAE is a web application that evaluates entire websites and generates multiple levels of reports, organized by evaluation rule categories. The generated reports can be saved for future reference by registering for an account.

AInspector WCAG is a Firefox browser add-on that evaluates a single page and provides results that can be navigated in the browser sidebar. As in FAE, the results are organized by evaluation rule categories, but are not readily archivable.

## Visualization Tools

The Accessibility Bookmarklets is a suite of tools that  provide web developers and designers with ways of visualizing accessibility features and information that is otherwise hidden on the page.

They do not evaluate the page based on accessibility requirements or rules, but are useful for gaining an overview of particular categories of accessibility requirements, as well as performing certain types of manual checks.

## Embedded HTML Editor for Producing Accessible Content

The A11yFirst for CKEditor project seeks to transform the web content authoring model from reactive to proactive, by creating an authoring environment that supports accessibility by default.
